    <h1>An Overview of New Zealand's North Island</h1>
    <h4>31 March 2017</h4>

    <p><img src="/assets/images/jucy.jpg" alt="jucy" class="triple" />
During my semester abroad at Auckland University, I had a 2 week mid-semester break, which I used to travel around the North Island of New Zealand using the Kiwi Experience bus route. Essentially, this is a pre-determined tour with various stops throughout all of New Zealand. Through this company, you can book excursions and hostels, making it very convenient for a solo backpacker like me to travel around without renting a car, worrying about being alone, etc. This post won’t go too much into the details of my time with Kiwi Experience but will instead focus on what I saw on the North Island and will also include other highlights of the North Island I saw on weekend trips during my semester. To make things organized, I’ll start with my weekend trips (since they were all north of the Kiwi Experience trip) and then work my way down south. For the tl;dr, you can simply read the headings of each day and click <a href="#tips">here</a> for the advice I would give to anyone about to travel throughout the South Island.</p>

<em>Te Paki Sand Dunes</em>
On a weekend trip, I drove up with two friends all the way to the most northern tip of New Zealand, Cape Reinga. We stayed in an Airbnb on the Karikari Peninsula so we could easily drive around the area. We got to slide down giant sand dunes and see the sunset at the Cape Reinga lighthouse.

<em>Cape Reinga</em>
On our drive back down to Auckland, we made a large detour to see New Zealand’s oldest Kauri tree.
Overall, I am glad I got to check these three things off my New Zealand bucket list, but the drive was very much out of the way so if I were doing a trip around the North Island (which would probably start in Auckland), I’m not sure I would drive all the way up just for Cape Reinga.

<em>On a sailboat</em>
I went to the Bay of Islands twice and by far the must-do activity is go sailing. The first time, we simply hiked and walked around but that won’t get you out onto the water to see what this area is all about. Though this is north of Auckland and “out of the way” of a journey throughout New Zealand, I would say that if you are willing to spend the money to go out sailing, it would be worth it. Both times, I stayed in Paihia, a cute little town on the water which has a great outdoor market of goods if you’re there at the right time.
The area is also known for its waterfalls. If you are feeling a bit adventurous, I would highly recommend going to the Rainbow Falls in Kerikeri. You can swim inside and, if you’re dumb like us, jump off into the water.

<h2 id="the-takeaways">The Takeaways…</h2>
<p>For anyone traveling throughout the South Island, here are the main things I would keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>SANDFLIES</em> : these stupid little pests were probably my least favorite part of the whole 2 weeks. They like to be near water, so you’re most likely to find them on the West Coast but honestly, I feel like they followed me the entire time. The best thing to do is use repellant and wear long sleeves but be careful… sometimes they would even bite me through my thin socks! The bites can flare up and itch at random times.</li>
  <li>Paper maps/guidebooks: I’m used to using Google for everything: maps, accommodation searching, drive times, etc. However, on this trip, we faced limited data, limited cell service, and limited battery life, all of which made paper guides our biggest source of help. A friend gave me the Lonely Planet New Zealand Guidebook for my birthday last year and it was essential to finding hostels and other information.</li>
  <li>Spontaneity: this is something I’m really bad at but Zora is really good at, which I definitely think made our trip so much better. Even though we had to plan things like kayaking or the swing, some of the coolest moments we had were completely unplanned. We would see a sign that intrigued us or would want to explore more of an area so we would just get off the highway and go explore. New Zealand offers so much more than just the touristy spots you’ve read about. For me, its hidden treasures are what make it so beautiful.</li>
</ul>
